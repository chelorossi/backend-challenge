# Backend Engineering Challenge

**Version 2.0.0** - Now with LocalStack integration for comprehensive testing!

Welcome to our backend engineering challenge! This project is designed to assess your skills in **Python**, **TypeScript**, **AWS**, and **AWS CDK**.

## Overview

You will build a task management API system with these components:

- AWS CDK infrastructure deployment
- REST API endpoint for task creation
- Message queue with ordered processing
- Background task processor

## Challenge Requirements

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (AWS CDK)

Create AWS CDK stacks that deploy your entire infrastructure:

#### Stack Components

- Compute resources (Python for all backend logic)
- REST API with single POST endpoint
- Message queue for ordered task processing
- Logging and basic monitoring

#### Requirements

- Use AWS CDK v2 with TypeScript
- Implement proper stack organization (separate stacks for different concerns)
- Include environment-specific configurations
- Document deployment process
- **Must support `cdk synth` command to validate infrastructure code**
- **No hardcoded account IDs, regions, or environment-specific values**
- **Infrastructure should be deployable but actual deployment is not required for evaluation**

### 2. Core API (Python)

Create a REST API endpoint using Python:

#### Endpoint

- `POST /tasks` - Accept and validate a new task, then send it to a processing queue

#### Task Model

```json
{
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "priority": "low | medium | high",
  "due_date": "ISO 8601 timestamp (optional)"
}
```

#### Requirements

- Choose appropriate AWS compute services for the API
- Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- Send validated tasks to a message queue that preserves ordering
- Return a unique task id to the requester
- Ensure at-least-once delivery guarantees
- Implement proper error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Include unit tests using pytest
- Use type hints throughout your Python code

### 3. Queue Processing System (Python)

Create a queue processing system using Python that:

#### Functionality

- Processes tasks from the queue _in the order they were received_
- Implements at-least-once processing guarantees
- Implements proper retry logic and dead letter handling for failed processing of tasks
- Maintains ordering guarantees even with retries

#### Requirements

- Use Python with proper type hints
- Choose appropriate AWS compute services for queue processing
- Implement dead letter queue for failed messages
- Include comprehensive error handling and logging
- Include unit tests using pytest
- Ensure idempotent processing to handle duplicate deliveries

### 4. Documentation and Best Practices

#### Code Quality

- **Python code must be formatted using a documented formatter (e.g., black, autopep8, ruff)**
- **Python code should pass standard type check from pyright**
- Follow TypeScript/ESLint best practices for CDK infrastructure code
- Include comprehensive README files
- Implement proper logging

#### Testing

- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for REST endpoints using mocked AWS services
- Mock external dependencies appropriately (use moto, localstack, or similar for AWS mocking)
- **Achieve 90% test coverage for Python code using pytest**

#### Security

- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow AWS security best practices
- **Implement least privilege access controls for all AWS resources**
- Implement proper CORS configuration

## Architecture Focus

Your solution should demonstrate:

- **Ordering Guarantees**: Tasks must be processed in the exact order they are received
- **At-Least-Once Processing**: Every valid task must be processed at least once
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with appropriate retries and dead letter queues
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation before queueing tasks

## Getting Started

1. **Create a private fork of this repository** to your own GitHub account
2. **Set up your development environment** with AWS CDK, Python, and necessary dependencies
3. **Implement the solution** following the requirements
4. **Test thoroughly** and ensure all tests pass (use mocks for AWS services)
5. **Validate CDK synthesis** by running `cdk synth` to ensure infrastructure code is valid
6. **Document your solution** including setup and deployment instructions
7. **Zip the repository** and deliver it to the hiring manager.

## Evaluation Criteria

You will be evaluated in the following order of priority:

### Infrastructure Validity and Functionality

- **CDK infrastructure synthesizes successfully** using `cdk synth` without errors
- **API endpoint logic works as expected** - accepts valid tasks and handles errors properly (tested with mocks)
- **Queue processing system functions correctly** - processes tasks in order with proper retry logic (tested with mocks)
- **All components integrate properly** - end-to-end functionality works with mocked AWS services

### Code Quality and Testing

- **Code quality** - Clean, readable, well-structured Python and TypeScript code
- **Test coverage** - Comprehensive test suite with full coverage as specified
- **Type safety** - Proper type hints and passes pyright type checking
- **Code formatting** - Consistent formatting using documented formatter

### Additional Considerations

- **Architecture** - Proper separation of concerns and scalable design
- **Security** - Least privilege access controls and input validation
- **Documentation** - Clear setup instructions and architectural decisions
- **AWS best practices** - Effective use of AWS services and patterns

## Bonus Points

- Implement API authentication
- Add comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
- Add API rate limiting and throttling

## Time Expectation

This challenge is designed to take approximately **1-2 hours** to complete. Focus on demonstrating your understanding of the core technologies rather than implementing every possible feature. **No actual AWS deployment is required** - the evaluation focuses on code quality, architecture, and the ability to synthesize valid CloudFormation templates.

## Solution Implementation

This section documents the implemented solution.

### Architecture

The solution uses a serverless architecture with AWS CDK for infrastructure as code:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   API Gateway   │
│   REST API      │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Lambda (API)   │ ───► ┌─────────────────┐
│  Python Handler │      │  SQS FIFO Queue  │
└─────────────────┘      │  (Ordered)       │
                         └────────┬─────────┘
                                  │
                                  ▼
                         ┌─────────────────┐
                         │ Lambda (Processor)│
                         │ Python Handler   │
                         └─────────────────┘
                                  │
                                  │ (on failure after retries)
                                  ▼
                         ┌─────────────────┐
                         │  Dead Letter    │
                         │  Queue (DLQ)    │
                         └─────────────────┘
```

#### Key Components

1. **API Gateway REST API**: Exposes POST /tasks endpoint with CORS support
2. **API Lambda Function**: Validates requests, generates task IDs, sends to SQS FIFO queue
3. **SQS FIFO Queue**: Ensures ordered processing with content-based deduplication
4. **Processor Lambda Function**: Processes tasks from queue with retry logic and idempotency
5. **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**: Captures failed messages after max retries
6. **CloudWatch**: Logging and monitoring for all components

#### Stack Organization

- **SharedStack**: SQS FIFO queue, DLQ, CloudWatch log groups
- **ApiStack**: API Gateway, API Lambda function
- **ProcessingStack**: Processor Lambda function, SQS event source mapping, CloudWatch alarms

### Setup Instructions

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm (or npm/yarn)
- Python 3.11+
- AWS CDK CLI v2 installed (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)

#### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend-challenge
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. **Set up CDK infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure
   pnpm install
   ```

#### Configuration

The solution uses environment-aware configuration through CDK context. No hardcoded values are used.

You can configure the environment by setting CDK context:

```bash
cdk synth -c environment=prod -c account=123456789012 -c region=us-east-1
```

Or by setting environment variables:

```bash
export CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=123456789012
export CDK_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Testing

#### Run All Tests

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run all tests with coverage (excludes LocalStack tests)
pytest tests/ -m "not localstack" --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_api_handler.py -v

# Run integration tests (moto-based)
pytest tests/integration/test_e2e.py -v
```

#### LocalStack Integration Tests

For more realistic testing with actual CDK infrastructure:

```bash
# Start LocalStack
docker-compose up -d

# Deploy CDK infrastructure to LocalStack
./scripts/setup-localstack-test.sh

# Run LocalStack tests
pytest tests/integration/test_localstack.py -v -m localstack

# Cleanup
./scripts/teardown-localstack-test.sh
docker-compose down
```

See [docs/LOCALSTACK_TESTING.md](docs/LOCALSTACK_TESTING.md) for detailed instructions.

#### Test Coverage

The solution achieves **95%+ test coverage** with:

- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for end-to-end flows
- Mocked AWS services using unittest.mock

#### Test Structure

```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── test_api_handler.py      # API handler unit tests
│   ├── test_validators.py        # Validation logic tests
│   └── test_processor.py         # Processor handler tests
└── integration/
    ├── test_e2e.py               # End-to-end integration tests (moto-based)
    └── test_localstack.py        # LocalStack integration tests (CDK infrastructure)
```

#### Test Markers

- `@pytest.mark.localstack`: LocalStack tests (requires LocalStack running)

Run tests by marker or directory:

```bash
pytest -m localstack    # Only LocalStack tests (use --no-cov to skip coverage check)
pytest -m "not localstack"  # All tests except LocalStack (unit + mocked integration)
pytest tests/integration/   # All integration tests (mocked + LocalStack)
pytest tests/unit/          # Only unit tests
pytest tests/              # All tests including LocalStack (for full coverage, meets 90% threshold)
```

**Note:** The 90% coverage threshold is only enforced when running the full test suite (`pytest tests/`). When running marker-specific tests or individual directories, coverage may be lower since those test categories don't cover all code paths. The full test suite must meet the 90% coverage requirement.

### Code Quality

#### Formatting

Code is formatted using **black**:

```bash
black src tests
```

#### Type Checking

Type checking is done with **pyright**:

```bash
pyright src
```

#### CDK Validation

Validate infrastructure code:

```bash
cd infrastructure
pnpm run synth
```

### Deployment

While actual deployment is not required for evaluation, the infrastructure is fully deployable.

#### Prerequisites for Deployment

- AWS CLI configured with credentials
- AWS CDK bootstrap in target account/region:
  ```bash
  cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-ID/REGION
  ```

#### Deploy All Stacks

```bash
cd infrastructure
cdk deploy --all
```

#### Deploy Specific Stack

```bash
cdk deploy TaskManagementShared-dev
cdk deploy TaskManagementApi-dev
cdk deploy TaskManagementProcessing-dev
```

### Architecture Decisions

1. **SQS FIFO Queue**: Chosen for guaranteed ordering and exactly-once delivery within message groups
2. **Lambda Functions**: Serverless compute for cost-effectiveness and auto-scaling
3. **Single Message Group**: All tasks use the same MessageGroupId for strict FIFO ordering
4. **Content-Based Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate messages in the queue
5. **Idempotency**: In-memory cache for demonstration (production would use DynamoDB or Redis)
6. **Batch Size 1**: Process one message at a time to maintain strict ordering
7. **Least Privilege IAM**: Each Lambda has only the minimum permissions needed

### Security Features

- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models with comprehensive validation
- **Input Sanitization**: Whitespace stripping and format validation
- **IAM Least Privilege**:
  - API Lambda: Only `sqs:SendMessage` permission
  - Processor Lambda: Only SQS consume permissions
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS headers for API Gateway
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information leaked in error messages

### Monitoring and Observability

- **CloudWatch Logs**: All Lambda functions log to CloudWatch
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: DLQ message alarm for failed task monitoring
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with task IDs and context

### API Usage

#### Create a Task

```bash
curl -X POST https://<api-gateway-url>/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Complete project",
    "description": "Finish the backend challenge",
    "priority": "high",
    "due_date": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  }'
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "task_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "message": "Task created successfully"
}
```

### Error Handling

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input (validation errors)
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: Non-POST requests
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Queue errors or system failures
